# Why developing another Petri editor?

Because:
- This project has started as a continuation of
  [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/)'s (max,+) toolbox that my father
  developed at INRIA and which is no longer developed. There are no Petri
  editors with (max,+) on GitHub. Currently, there is no Petri net editors
  available for Julia.
- Many Petri net editors in GitHub are no longer maintained (> 7 years) or that
  I cannot personally compile or use (Windows system, Visual Studio compiler,
  C#, Java ..) or the code is too complex (no comments) to add my own
  extensions.
