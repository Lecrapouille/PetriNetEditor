# What are Petri nets, timed Petri nets, timed event graph?

## Petri nets and derived types

Petri nets are one of several mathematical modeling languages for the
description of distributed systems and synchronization of their processes. It is
a class of discrete event dynamic systems.

- A Petri net is a directed bipartite graph that has two types of nodes: places
and transitions respectively depicted as circles and rectangles. A place can
contain zero or any positive number of tokens, usually depicted either as black
circles or as numbers. Arcs, depicted by arrows, allows directing two nodes of
different types: either from a place to a transition or from a transition to a
place. A transition is activated if all places connected to it as inputs contain
at least one token. When a transition is activated a token is burnt from each of
these places and added to each place connected as outputs to this
transition. Usually, the numbers of tokens in places depict the states of the
systems, tokens represent the resources of the system and transitions describe
the synchronization of resources (rendez-vous).

- Coloured Petri net is a backward compatible extension. They allow tokens to have
a data value attached to them. This attached data value is called the token
color.

- A Petri net is called a state machine if each transition has exactly one
upstream and one downstream place.

- A Petri net is called an event graph if each place has exactly
one upstream and one downstream transition.

- In timed Petri nets or timed event graphs, "place -> transition" arcs are evaluated with strictly positive duration values which simulate the times needed by places to perform their associated action.

- GRAFCET (GRAphe Fonctionnel de Commande Etapes-Transitions in French, aka SFC
(Sequential Function Chart in English) are derived from Petri net for engineers
allowing the representation and the analysis of automata. They are particularly
well suited for systems with sequential evolution (which are decomposable into
steps). Places have zero or one tokens. As long as a place has a token, discrete
actions associated to it are performed (i.e. close the door, switch on the light
after a delay of X ms ...). Contrary to Petri net where transition can be see
with a boolean experssion always set to true, GRAFCET transitions have boolean
expressions associated to them (i.e. button pressed and door is closed) and when
this expression is true it allows burning tokens of upstream places as descrived
for classic Petri nets. GRAFCET offers some extra features like reseting tokens
to a given configuration (forÃ§age in French).

### Example

The above figure is a timed Petri net.

![EventGraph](pics/TimedPetri01.png)

*Fig 1 - Timed Petri net (made with this editor).*

Tthere are 5 transitions (`T0, T1, T2, T3, T4`) and 4 places (`P0, P1, P2, P3`). Places `P0` and `P1` have 1 token each, the place `P1` has 2 tokens and the place `P2` has 0 token. Transitions `T0, T1, T2, T4` are activated (green) but the transition T3 is not activated (no color) since all of their upstream places have at least one token.
The arc `T0 -> P1` has 3 units of times to simulate the fact that `P1` will need this duration to perform its action. In [literature](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/metalau/cohen/SED/book-online.html)
timed event graphs are displayed with vertical bars inside places: they indicate
holding times of these places (in time units). In our net editor bars are displayed
as numbers on arcs going to places.

Inputs of nets are transitions with no upstream places. Outputs of event
graphs are transitions with downstream places. In figure 1, there are no inputs
and no outputs.

### What decision is made when several transitions can burn tokens from the same place?

Question: In above figure 1, the place `P1` has two tokens and has two
leaving arcs `P1 -> T1` and `P1 -> T2`. How transitions `T1` and `T2` will burn
tokens in `P1` and therefore in which arc tokens will transit to?

Answer: This is named `or-divergent branching`. Unless you want to simulate a system with concurrences between resources,
this kind of net is a bad design and should be avoided when architecturing real
systems since the execution of this kind of Petri net is nondeterministic: when
multiple transitions are enabled at the same time, they will fire in any
order. Therefore you should adapt your Petri net to define uniquely
the trajectory of the token. With GRAFCET, designers add mutual exclusion expression in receptivities (i.e. `T1` will be `"button1 pressed"` and `T2` will `"(button2 pressed) and (not button1 pressed)"`).

## Type of net managed by this editor

This editor allows to edit and simulate (timed) Petri nets, (timed) event graph
and partially GRAFCET. It does not manage coloured Petri nets (probably one day) neither
state-machines (because to fire we need to click on transitions and in this mode transitions will not be shown). If you are interested by state machines, you may be more
interested by a more modern form [Harel's
statecharts](https://www.itemis.com/en/products/itemis-create/documentation/user-guide/overview_what_are_state_machines)
or better
[synccharts](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Charles.Andre/CA%20Publis/Cesa96/SyncCharts_Cesa96.pdf)
a graphical subset of the
[Esterel](https://www.college-de-france.fr/sites/default/files/documents/gerard-berry/UPL8106359781114103786_Esterelv5_primer.pdf)
language (i.e. used in Airbus).

When running timed Petri net simulations with this editor, tokens will transit along the arcs of the net. When transitions are activated, tokens are instantaneously burnt from places and directly "teleported" to transitions. Then, they will move along the
arc from the transition to the place. This "travel" will hold the number of
seconds indicated by the arc. This symbolized the time needed for the Place to
perform its action. A fading effect will help to show you which arcs and
nodes are activated.

A non-deterministic execution policy is made at the discretion of editor developers and you will have different behavior depending on how the editor has been developed. Currently in our case, initially, the order when iterating on
transitions and arcs only depends on their order of creation but now we
randomize.  When several places are fired, the maximum possible of tokens will
be burned within a single step of the animation cycle but, internally, we iterate
over tokens one by one to help dispatch them over the maximum number of arcs.
Therefore, in this particular example, since `T1` has been created before `T2`
(unique identifiers are incremented by one from zero and there is no gap), the
1st token will go to `T1` and the second will go to `T2`. If `P1` had a single
token, in early `T1` will always be chosen but in the latest version, we randomize.

### Note concerning node identifiers

In this editor, for a given type (place and transitions), unique identifiers are
unsigned integers `0 .. N`.  Numbers shall be consecutive and without
"holes". This is important when generating graphs defined by adjacency
matrices: indices of the matrix will directly match unique identifiers and
therefore no lookup table is needed. To distinguish the type of node a `T` or
`P` char is also prepended to the number. Arcs have no identifier because their
relation to directing nodes is unique since this editor does not manage multi
arcs. Therefore, when deleting a place (or a transition) the latest place (or
latest transition) in the container gets the unique identifier of the deleted
element to guarantee consecutive identifiers without "holes".

## Timed Graph Events

A timed event graph is a subclass of Petri net in which all places have a single
input arc and a single output arc. This property allows to forbid, for example,
the or-divergent branching (choice between several transitions), and therefore
concurrency is never occurring. Transitions still may have several arcs because
they simulate synchronization between resources. Places can have zero or several
tokens. In above figure 1, the net is not an event graph since `P0` has 3
incoming arcs and `P2` has two output arcs but the following figure 2 is an
event graph. Timed Graph Events are interesting for designing real-time
systems as explained in the next sections.

### Compact form of timed event graphs

Thanks to the property of event graphs in which places have a single input arc and single arc, another way to represent event graphs in a more compact form, is to merge places with their unique incoming and unique out-coming arcs. From figure 2, we obtain the following figure 3, which is a more compact graph but equivalent. For example, the arc `5.00, P0(2)` means the place `P0` with 2 tokens and 2 units of time for the arc `T0 T2`.

![Graph](pics/Graph01.png)

*Fig 3 - A compact form of figure 2 (made with this editor).*

Since, graphs can be represented by adjacency matrices, and since, arcs hold two information (duration and tokens), event graphs can be represented by two matrices (generally sparse): one matrix for duration `N` and the second matrix for tokens `T`. And since, event graphs have good properties with the (max,+) algebra, this editor can generate this kind of matrix directly in this algebra which can be used by the [MaxPlus](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MaxPlus.jl)
Julia package.

```
    | .  .  2  . |       | .  .  5  . |
    | 0  .  .  . |       | 5  .  .  . |
T = | .  0  .  0 |,  N = | .  3  .  1 |
    | 0  .  .  . |       | 1  .  .  . |
```

Let suppose that matrix indices start from `0`, then `T[0,2]` holds 2 tokens and `N[0,2]` holds the duration 5. The `[0,2]` means the arc `T0 -> T2` in the compact form (or arcs `T0 -> P0` and `P0 -> T2` in the classic Petri form).

Note that origin and destination are inversed, this is because the matrix convention is generally the following: `M . x` with `x` a column vector. This editor can generate some Julia script. Note that `Îµ` in (max,+) algebra means that there is no existing arc.

### Dater and Counter Form

Event graphs represent when system events are occurring. We have two different
way to represent them: the counter form, and the dater form.

The counter form of the event graph in figure 2 is:
```
T0(t) = min(0 + T3(t - 1), 0 + T1(t - 5))
T1(t) = min(0 + T2(t - 3))
T2(t) = min(2 + T0(t - 5))
T3(t) = min(0 + T2(t - 1))
```

where `t - 5`, `t - 3` and `t - 1` are delays implied by duration on arcs and `min(2 +` and `min(0 +` implied by tokens from incoming places. `0 +` are just here to highlight the absence of tokens.

The dater form of the event graph in figure 2 is:
```
T0(n) = max(1 + T3(n - 0), 5 + T1(n - 0))
T1(n) = max(3 + T2(n - 0))
T2(n) = max(5 + T0(n - 2))
T3(n) = max(1 + T2(n - 0))
```

where `n - 0` and `n - 2` are delays implied by tokens from incoming places and
`max(5 +`, `max(3 + ` and `max(1 +` are implied by durations from incoming arcs.

In both cases, these kinds of formulas are not easy to manipulate and the (max,+)
algebra is here to simplify them. This algebra introduces the operator â¨ instead
of the usual multiplication in classic algebra, and the operator â¨ (usually
simply noted as `.` or without symbol) instead of the usual `max()` function in classic
algebra. The (min,+) algebra also exists (the operator â¨ is the `min()`
function) and for more information about (max,+) algebra, see my
[MaxPlus](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MaxPlus.jl) Julia package which
contains tutorials explaining more deeply this algebra.

The (min,+) algebra, for event graphs, is less convenient since the dater form is
more friendly than the counter form for two reasons:
- on a real-time system the number of resources (tokens) is reduced compared to
  duration needed to perform tasks (duration on arcs) which can be arbitrary
  long (for example 2 resources (2 delays) versus 2 hours when your system is
  scheduled at 1 Hz (7200 delays). Remember that in a discrete-time system each
  delay costs one variable (memory) to hold the value.
- thanks to the canonical form (explained in the next section) delays can
  simplify be either 0 or 1.

Therefore, the counter form of the event graph in (max,+) algebra is:
```
T0(t) = T3(t - 1) â¨ T1(t - 5)
T1(t) = T2(t - 3)
T2(t) = 2 T0(t - 5)
T3(t) = T2(t - 1)
```

The dater form of the event graph in (min,+) algebra is:
```
T0(n) = 1 T3(n - 2) â¨ 5 T1(n - 0)
T1(n) = 3 T0(n - 0)
T2(n) = 5 T0(n - 2)
T3(n) = 1 T2(n)
```

### Canonical Event Graph

An event graph is said canonical when all places have at most one token and when
places after an input transition (meaning a transition without predecessor) have
no token and when places before an output transition (meaning a transition
without successor) have no token. Any event graph can be transformed to its
canonical form: a place with N tokens can be seen as N consecutive places
holding each a single token. For system inputs and system outputs having one
token in place, we can simply add an extra empty place.

The graph in figure 2 is not canonical since `P0` has two tokens. The following
figure is the same event graph but in its canonical form: one token `P0` has
been transferred to the newly created `P5` place.

![CanonicalEventGraph](pics/CanoEventGraph01.png)

*Fig 4 - Canonical Event Graph (made with this editor).*

A canonical event graph can directly be converted into an implicit dynamic
linear systems inside the (max,+) algebra (see section after) but since editing
canonical net is fastidious and therefore the editor will deal it and let the
user can directly manipulate the compact form of event graph.

### Implicit max-plus Dynamic Linear Systems

Canonical event graphs are interesting since their dater form can be modeled by
an implicit dynamic linear system with the (max,+) algebra, which has the
following form:

```
    X(n) = D â¨ X(n) â¨ A â¨ X(n-1) â¨ B â¨ U(n)
    Y(n) = C â¨ X(n)
```

Or using the compact syntax:
```
    X(n) = D X(n) â¨ A X(n-1) â¨ B U(n)
    Y(n) = C X(n)
```

In where `A, B, C, D` are (max,+) matrices: `B` is named controlled matrix, `C` the observation matrix, `A` the state matrix (places with 1 token), and `D` the implicit matrix (places without token). `U` the column vector of system inputs (transitions with no predecessor), `Y` the system outputs (transitions with no successor), and `X` the systems states as a column vector (transitions with successor and predecessor), `n` in `X(n)`, `U(n)`, `Y(n)` are places with no token, and `n-1` in `X(n-1)` are places having a single token. Note: that is why, in the previous section, we said that canonical form has its input and
output places with no token. This editor can generate these (max,+) sparse matrices (for Julia), for example from figure 3:

```
    | .  5  .  1  . |       | .  .  .  .  . |
    | .  .  3  .  . |       | .  .  .  .  . |
D = | .  .  .  .  . |,  A = | .  .  .  .  5 |
    | .  .  1  .  . |       | .  .  .  .  . |
    | .  .  .  .  . |       | 0  .  .  .  . |

```

Matrix indices start from `0`. `[i,j]` (of matrices `A, B, C, D`) refers to the arc `Tj -> P -> Ti`. Note, the direction is inversed because of matrix multiplication `A x` convention.

`D` ares for arcs transition to transition with places having no tokens. `D[2,3]` holds the duration 1 (unit of times) and means the arc `T2 -> P4 -> T3`).

`A` ares for arcs transition to transition with places having a single tokens. `A[4,2]` holds the duration 5 (unit of times) and 1 token (the arc `T4 -> P0 -> T2`).

Since this particular net has no input and outputs, there are no U, Y, B, or C matrices. Note: `.` is the compact form of the (max,+) number `Îµ` which is the `-â` in classic algebra means that there is no existing arc (usually, these kinds of matrices are sparse since they can be huge but with few elements stored).

Let give an example with inputs and outputs. The following figure 5 show an network with one input and one output.

![JPQ](pics/JPQPetri.png)

*Fig 5 - Network with one input and one output (made with this editor).*

and corresponds to this graph:

![graph](pics/JPQgraph.png)

The matrices are:

```
    | .  . |      | 3  7 |      | . |
D = | .  . |, A = | 2  4 |, B = | 1 |, C = | 3 . |
```


These kinds of systems are interesting for real-time systems because they can show to the critical circuit of the system (in duration). The algorihm used is [Howard](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gaubert/HOWARD2.html). This editor can show the critical circuit as shown in the next figure 5 where the circuit `T0, T2, T1` will consume 13 units of time (5 + 5 + 3) for 2 tokens (in `P0`) and therefore 6.5 units of time by token (this information is for the moment displayed on the console). In this example there is a single connected components for the optimal policy.
